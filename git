git branch -M main (to rename branch if default is set to - master)
git push origin main (to push your repository in main branch)

to set your branch defualt -= git push -u origin main

WorkFlow-

Github - code changes ->commit
Local Git(on vs code) - code change -> add(stage change) -> commit(commit change) ->push

Branch Command -

git checkout <-branch name-> (to navigate to the branch name)
git checkout -b <-new branch name-> (to create new branch)
git branch -d <-branch name-> (to delete any branch)
git push --set-upstream origin <-branch name-> (to add new branch on github)

Merging Code -

git diff <-branch name-> (to compare commits, branches, files & more)
git merge <-branch name-> (to merge 2 branches)
OR
Pull request on github- lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on Github

push command - local -> github
pull command - github -> local
